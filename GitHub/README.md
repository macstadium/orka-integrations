# Official Support Deprecation

## May 6, 2024

As of May 6, 2024 this Github Actions Integration is no longer officially supported and is now deprecated in favor of the new [one](https://github.com/macstadium/orka-github-actions-integration/). The code owner will still maintain and provide long term support, without official guarantee.

## Orka-GitHub Actions Integration

The Orka-GitHub Actions integration provides guides on how to use [Orka by MacStadium][orka] in a GitHub Actions workflow.  
You can find guides on how to set up [multiple runners automatically](multiple-self-hosted-runners.md), [a single runner automatically](single-self-hosted-runner.md) and [a single runner manually](self-hosted-runner-manually.md).
